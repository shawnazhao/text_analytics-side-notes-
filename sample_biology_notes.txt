Prokaryotes: •	Prokaryotes are a basic type of cell, characterised by the presence or absence of particular organelles •	Prokaryotes lack internal membrane-bound organelles, do not have a defined nucleus, are significantly smaller than eukaryotes, and exist as unicellular organisms. •	They emerged around 3.5 billion years ago, and are considered to be the first “actual” cells •	Bacteria and archaea are prokaryotic cells•	These cells are typically 0.1 – 1 μm in sizeCells as the Basis of Life Synergy Education Eukaryotes: Eukaryotes are a more complex cell type, containing membrane-bound organelles, and a membrane-bound nucleus.     -  These cells include plant and animal cells and fungi cells    -  Eukaryotic cells are typically 7 – 100 μm in size    -  Eukaryotic cells can be unicellular, colonial, or multicellularThe phospholipid bilayer:Phospholipids are molecules consisting of a phosphate head and a lipid (fatty acid) tail- A typical phosphate is soluble in water or hydrophilic (water-loving)- A typical lipid is insoluble in water or hydrophobic (water-fearing)- The combination of the two forms a molecule that is amphipathic (bothhydrophobic and hydrophilic)• This amphipathic quality means that groups of phospholipids undergo ‘self-assembly.’- The phospholipids arrange into a two-layered sphere so that the hydrophilicphosphate heads face out towards water and the hydrophobic lipid tails faceinwards- The phospholipid bilayer is used not only for cell membranes but internalmembranes of organelles like the liposome as well!Cholesterol:  Cholesterol is a steroid (a type of hormone) that manages the fluidity of the phospholipids  Remember that in the phospholipid bilayer, no bonds are formed between the phospholipids making the molecules move laterally (sideways) fluidly  This could be a disadvantage if the phospholipids become too spaced apart and unwanted substances enter the cell, or if the space becomes too small and substances the cell requires cannot enter!  Cholesterol helps to manage the changes in membrane fluidity associated with temperatureProteins:  There are many types of proteins in the cell membrane! All these proteins are controllers of movement into and out of the cell.   Intrinsic proteins (sometimes called integral proteins) are embedded in the membrane and extend across both layers of the membrane.   These proteins are most useful for transporting molecules into and out of the cell   There are many types of intrinsic proteins:   Protein channels facilitate the passive movement of large particles – this iscalled facilitated diffusion   Carrier (transport) proteins assists in the active transport of molecules   Receptor proteins receive chemical signals from outside the cell that triggersa chemical response, achieving intercellular communicationExtrinsic proteins (sometimes called peripheral proteins) are embedded in the membrane but don’t extend across the entire membrane – these help with communicationGlycoproteins and Glycolipids:Glycoproteins and glycolipids are formed when a carbohydrate molecule attaches to the surface of a protein or lipidGlycoproteins serve as antigens which allow organisms to recognise self and non-self cells, and control some aspects of the immune responseGlycoproteins and glycolipids also serve as receptor molecules, binding to some hormones which affect the functioning of the cellTransport through the Membrane:In general, the structure of the membrane and the fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer allows small, uncharged particles to move by passive transport through the membraneLarge or charged must cross the membrane through special pathways, such as protein channels.Glycoproteins and glycolipids also serve as receptor molecules, binding to some hormones which affect the functioning of the cell
